# RISC-V Pipelined Processor (B.Tech 3rd Year Theme-Based Project)

This is a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor implemented in **Verilog**. It supports a wide range of ALU operations along with basic memory, branching, and jumping instructions. Developed as a part of my **3rd year theme-based project (B.Tech ECE '25)**, this work demonstrates my strong foundation and passion for **VLSI design** and **digital system architecture**.

##  How to Run
```bash 
 1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Akhil03112003/RISC-V-pipeline-processor.git
cd riscv-pipeline-processor
```


2. Write RISC-V Assembly Code
Create a file named code.asm.

Write valid RISC-V instructions supported by the processor:
```
ADD x3, x1, x2
SUB x4, x3, x5
SW x4, 0(x6)
```
3. Compile Assembly to HEX
Use the custom-built compiler to convert the assembly program to machine-readable hex format:
```
python3 compiler.py
```
This generates a program.hex file.

The hex file contains binary-equivalent instructions based on RISC-V formats (R/I/L/S/B/J types).

4. Load HEX File into Instruction Memory
The InstructionMemory.v module reads the program.hex file during simulation.

Each instruction is loaded at its corresponding address in the instruction memory.

5. Simulate the Processor in Vivado/ModelSim
Load all Verilog modules and the testbench in your simulation environment.

Begin simulation and observe waveform outputs.

### ðŸ”§ Module-Wise Architecture Overview

| Stage | Modules | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **IF**  | `PC.v`, `InstructionMemory.v` | Fetches the instruction from memory |
| **ID**  | `instruction_decode.v`, `ControlUnit.v`, `RegisterFile.v`, `HazardDetectionUnit.v` | Decodes instructions, reads registers, handles RAW hazards |
| **EX**  | `ALU.v`, `ForwardingUnit.v` | Performs ALU operations, resolves hazards using forwarding |
| **MEM** | `DataMemory.v` | Executes memory operations (`LW`, `SW`) |
| **WB**  | Write-back logic in `mem_wb.v` | Writes result back to the register file |

ðŸ“Œ Between each stage, pipeline registers (`if_id.v`, `id_ex.v`, `ex_mem.v`, `mem_wb.v`) pass the relevant data forward.
